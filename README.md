# Buzz Circle Server

####  This is a REST API that provides access to resources such as 'posts' and 'users' (stored in a NoSQL database), and allows performing CRUD operations to them. It supports authentication and protected routes using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and user roles. This API is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) and is the backend of the [Buzz Circle app](https://github.com/BMiguelDev/buzz-circle), which deploys a social blog app using this API's functionalities.

#### Developed using NodeJS, ExpressJs and MongoDB
